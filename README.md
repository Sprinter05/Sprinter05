### 🚀 My current projects
- I'm currently developing a **Discord** bot using the [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/) library for a trading card game based on the _Paper Mario_ games, the code will eventually be released here on Github.
- As a side project I have [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) frontend made using **batch** and **bash** scripts which aims to be compatible with any Windows version and Linux distribution. An android version will eventually be made in the future.
- I'm also currently working on tweaking my **dotfiles** for my Linux ricing.
    * I'm using [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/) as a distribution dual booted with [Windows 10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_10).
    * My _WM_ (Window Manager) is [qtile](https://qtile.org/) which I really like because everything is built on Python, including the configuration, so hacking into it is pretty easy and everything integrates very nicely.
- In the hardware side I'm on my way to build my own **homelab** where I will be hosting my different websites and services using [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). Once it's built I might document and post here my entire homelabbing experience.
